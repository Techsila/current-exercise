# current-exercise
StreamElements overlay for Fitness and health streams.

Design and idea by Techsila.
The inside of the widget (the chat command that connects to the current exercise) is based on this widget: https://strms.net/custom-text_by_benno

**How to set up**
1. Make a new overlay. Set it to 1080p and the size to 1920 x 1080 and have no margin/padding to the sides.
2. Make a new custom widget
3. Click the button "Open Editor"
4. Put the code in the fields. This project has different codes with different name, just like the widget: HTML / CSS / JS / Fields.
